Filter the media in your library by the taxonomies and terms with which they are associated.

== Description ==

This plugin adds 2 drop down menus to your Media Library (WordPress Admin Area > Media) which enable you to filter the media in your library by the taxonomies and terms (ie. categories) your media is associated with.

Media is generally "attached" to Posts, Pages, Custom Post Types, etc. All these types of posts can be associated with taxonomies and terms. This plugin allows you to filter media which is attached to any type of post by the taxonomies and terms related to those posts.

Plugin inspired by [answer on StackExchange](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/126873).

**Limitation**

The filters are only available when viewing your Media Library in "list" mode, not "grid" mode.
